"""Which images this stack fetches by digest, and how to resolve one.

EVERY image this stack pulls. `refresh_digests.py` walks this list for a human
bumping a version, and the tests check the compose files against it. If each kept its own list,
the one that was not edited would leave a digest behind — and a digest left
behind is not a stale pin, it is the WRONG IMAGE running silently, because
docker ignores the tag in `repo:tag@sha256:...`.

# mis-pinned the other.
